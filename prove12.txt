6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
Well if I had more time to work on this project I would like to add more features like more chat rooms for many categories, input a way to register new users, improve the designer, and put the functionality to add pictures and movies inside the chat.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
I think the chat covers all the categories, but we ever have something to improve for this reason I believe is near to  5.
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I think all the elements are working, have a good designer, but I believe that the designer could be a little good be better.
I run some tests and all the elements are working fine.
